    <h3>Easy Ways to Reduce Waste</h3>
    <p>Reducing waste can be super simple and really effective. Here are some easy tips to get you started:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Repurpose Everyday Items:</h4>
            <p>Old glass jars can be transformed into stylish storage solutions for pantry items or craft supplies. It’s a cost-effective way to stay organized and reduce waste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Upcycle Furniture:</h4>
            <p>Instead of throwing away old furniture, consider giving it a fresh look. A coat of paint or new fabric can turn a worn-out piece into a unique, one-of-a-kind item for your home.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Repair Instead of Replacing:</h4>
            <p>Small repairs can make a big difference. Learn basic skills to fix clothing, electronics, and more, keeping items in use and out of landfills.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Buy Second-Hand:</h4>
            <p>Shopping at thrift stores or online marketplaces not only saves money but also helps reduce demand for new products. Find great deals on items that are still in good condition.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Donate and Share:</h4>
            <p>If you have items you no longer need, consider donating them to charities or sharing them with friends and neighbors. This helps others and keeps items in circulation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Use Reusable Products: </h4>
            <p>Switching to reusable items like cloth bags, metal straws, and glass containers can significantly reduce the amount of single-use plastic you consume.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
